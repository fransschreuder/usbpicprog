          by a <language> tag; if this tag is not present, then DPINST will abort
          the driver installation (with failure) on those localized Window versions
          for which we didn't provide a translation! -->

    <!-- by default, DPINST installs only signed driver packages; with this tag we can
         tell DPINST to not abort if the CAT files of the drive rsignature are missing: -->

    <!-- configure DPINST to suppress the addition of entries to "Programs and Features"
         in Control Panel: the NSIS installer already adds one entry for "UsbPicProg": -->

    <!-- do not require user interaction for the installation of the drivers; this also
         gives us the advantage that we don't need to translate the messages which otherwise
         would be shown by DPINST: -->

    <!-- IMPORTANT: we do not want to use the <quietInstall/> tag because as MSDN says:
         "If DPInst is running in quiet-install mode and Windows requires a user interaction to complete 
          an installation, the installation will fail."
         Also, MSDN adds that "two typical situations that require user interaction are if Windows prompts 
         a user before installing an unsigned driver package or if Windows prompts a user for the location 
         of missing files."
         I.e. in our case, since we're delivering an unsigned driver package we need to allow Windows to 
         prompt the user about the fact that he's installing an unsigned driver, otherwise dpinst will fail
         leaving in the log file a message like:
            INFO:   RETURN: DriverPackagePreinstallW  (0xE000022F)
         which means "The third-party INF does not contain digital signature information."
